Wheat Seeds Dataset
The seeds dataset involves the prediction of species given measurements seeds from different varieties of wheat.

There are 201 records and 7 numerical input variables. It is a classification problem with 3 output classes. The scale for each numeric input value vary, so some data normalization may be required for use with algorithms that weight inputs like the backpropagation algorithm.
